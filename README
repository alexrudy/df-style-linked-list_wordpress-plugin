= Wordpress Linked List Plugin

* http://github.com/jonathanpenn/wordpress-linked-list-plugin

== DESCRIPTION:

Have designated posts act like the "Linked List" posts on Daring Fireball (http://daringfireball.net). Set the custom field "linked_list_url" to any desired destination on a post. The permalink then becomes that destination. Affects RSS feeds automatically and provides functions you can use in your template to control the layout if the post is a normal post, or a linked-list post".

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Wordpress 2.7+

== INSTALL/USAGE:

* Copy all the files in this repository to a directory in your "wp-content/plugins" directory. (name it something like "linked_list")
* Navigate to the plugins page in the backend and click "Activate" to enable it.
* When adding a link, just create a normal blog post with a description. Add a custom field "linked_list_url" with the desired destination.
* RSS Feeds will automatically have their link be replaced with the lined_list_url field value.
* Templates can be changed by using the provided functions to check whether your are rendering a linked list item or not. For example:

   ....the top part of a template....
   <?php if (have_posts()): ?>
      <?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>

        <?php if (is_linked_list()): ?>

          ...other HTML formatting...
          <a href="<?php the_linked_list_link()">This is a linked list link</a>
          ...other HTML formatting...

        <?php else: ?>

          ...other HTML formatting...
          <a href="<?php the_link()">This is a normal post link</a>
          ...other HTML formatting...

        <?php endif; ?>
      <?php endwhile; ?>
    <?php endif; ?>
    ...the rest of the template...


So, basically use the "is_linked_list()" function to check. And then alter your template the way you wish to make it look or act differently.
